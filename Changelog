  * nono on github made the Ruby more idiomatic and fixed a section
    which had eluded Gordon earlier.  He also added profiling, which
    can be run using "rake profiling" then opening profiling.html
    in a browser.
  * Raphael Knaus found an infinite loop error while parsing a nested
    list.  He provided a quick fix, but both he and I are dissatisfied
    by the current workaround.
