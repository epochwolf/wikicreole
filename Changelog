2009-08-12 (0.1.5)
  * Added information to the README about how to install from
    github

  * Artiom Diomin (kron4eg on github) made some changes to a
    fork of WikiCreole which looked interesting.  They primarily
    were related to cleaning up the gemspec file and allowing Github
    to automatically build the gem.  I took his changes mostly
    verbatim.
  * I also added a test for "release_attributes".  This is a test
    which only authors will really be interested in.  It ensures
    that the release is numbered/dated correctly.  This check used
    to be in the gemspec file, but I decided, based on Artiom's
    changes, that it made more sense as a test.  Reading more about
    the "jeweler" gem for releasing on github makes me think that
    perhaps I'm going about things the wrong way, though.

  * nono on github made the Ruby more idiomatic and fixed a section
    which had eluded Gordon earlier.  He also added profiling, which
    can be run using "rake profiling" then opening profiling.html
    in a browser.
  * Raphael Knaus found an infinite loop error while parsing a nested
    list.  He provided a quick fix, but both he and I are dissatisfied
    by the current workaround.

    the require 'wiki_creole' command

  * Added the version and date to the wiki_creole.rb file
